Stand-up notes: 

1.raphael, created page, setting up db locally; plans on starting with aws these next days. 
Has created html pages but not linking them. Focused on html,css; 
2.uriah, wants to focus on frontend aspect, finds the backend side to be more comfortable to work with 
3.ruben; setting up database
4.aliaksei, wants to be focused learning the servlets
5.felix, ran into an issue where html pages weren't getting changes; might be a servlet mapping issue..  

how we feel about the project: 
Time allocation to learning the frontend and actually working on the project;
